 * @section intro_sec Heads up
 * 
 * I decided not to use funcition pointers inside structures as a way to
 * implemente methods. Therefore, "methods" - meaning functions that operate
 * on an instance of a structure - cannot be found in the documentation of
 * its class (= structure) but only in the source file containing the defintion
 * of the class.
