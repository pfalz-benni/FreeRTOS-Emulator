# ESPL Exercises by Benedikt Witteler

This is the solution to the exercise part of the TUM ESPL.

## What is where?
1. Git-Exercise: TODO
2. Exercises 2, 3 and 4: here

## How to run the programm for exercises 2, 3 and 4?
Move into the build folder, run `cmake ..` to create a make file and run `make` in the same directory to build the project. The executable is created in the bin folder with the name FreeRTOS_Emulator.  

To switch between the solutions to exercises 2, 3 and 4 that are displayed on different screens press the button `E` on your keyboard.  

- Exercise 2: you can press the buttons `A, B, C, D` and move the mouse on the screen. The programm will react accordingly. To reset the counters for `A, B, C, D` press the left or the right mouse button.

- Exercise 3: To increment the numbers on the screen press `N` (counting task triggered by a task notification) or `S` (counting task triggered by a semaphore). Their value is reset to zero with a period of 15 seconds. To pause or resume the counter, counting the seconds passed since the launch of the program presse `P`.

- Exercise 4: There is no user input in this exercise. Only the outputs of the different tasks are printed on the screen.
